Freefrom Unit Converter
========================

Takes a plain text English dimensional conversion query, and computes the answer.  All in python, with no external program calls.

This project is running with a web front end at http://davidproj-env-xde4qr83jt.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Examples of inputs include:

	How many feet in a mile?
	
	32 meters to feet
	
	How many seconds are there in a fortnight?
	
	How far is 100 miles in marathons?
	
	How many in in a foot?
	
	Convert 100 f to kelvin.
	
	How tall is 100 feet in cm?
	
	10^(-32) decamiles in feet.
	
	in per ft
	
	10 marathons to km
	
	
The unit conversion factors are in units_data.py, and can be extended to many other types of dimensions.
